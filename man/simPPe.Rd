\title{
Simulate a spatial point pattern in a heterogeneous landscape
}
\description{
The function simulates a spatial point pattern in a heterogeneous landscape simulated on a square landscape. The study area ('core') is simulated inside the larger landscape that includes a buffer. The size of the core is defined by the lscape.size minus twice the buffer.

There is one habitat covariate X that affects the intensity of the points. X is spatially structured with negative-exponential spatial autocorrelation; the parameters of the field can be chosen to create large 'islands' of similar values or no 'islands' at all, in which case the field is spatially unstructured.

The intensity of STATIC points (e.g. animal activity centers) may be inhomogeneous and affected by the coefficient beta, which is the log-linear effect of X.

To recreate the data sets used in the book with R 3.6.0 or later, include \code{sample.kind="Rounding"} in the call to \code{set.seed}. This should only be used for reproduction of old results.

Previous versions used \pkg{RandomFields}, but that is not currently available on CRAN. If not available, \pkg{fields} will be used, but it cannot deal with large values of \code{lscape.size} and \code{theta.X}.

\usage{
simPPe(lscape.size = 150, buffer.width = 25, variance.X = 1, theta.X = 10,
  M = 250, beta = 1, quads.along.side = 6, show.plots = TRUE)
}

\arguments{
  \item{lscape.size}{
size (width = height) of the square landscape, including core and buffer.
}
  \item{buffer.width}{
width of buffer around core study area.
}
  \item{variance.X}{
variance of Gaussian random field (covariate X).
}
  \item{theta.X}{
scale parameter of correlation in field (must be >0).
}
  \item{M}{
expected number of activity centers in core area.
}
  \item{beta}{
coefficient of the habitat covariate.
}
  \item{quads.along.side}{
number of quadrats along the side of the core area; the total number of quadrats will be quads.along.side^2, thus indirectly defining the quadrat area.
}
  \item{show.plots}{
if TRUE, summary plots are displayed.
}
}
