Simulate data under a dynamic occupancy model with spatial autocorrelation
}
\description{
Function to simulate detection/nondetection data under a general dynamic site-occupancy model with autocorrelation, including:

* Annual variation in the probabilities of patch persistence, colonization and detection is specified by the bounds of a uniform distribution.

* One covariate is allowed to affect a parameter: a site covariate for psi1, site-by-year covariates for phi and gamma, and an observational covariate for p. Covariates are generated internally from uniform(-2, 2) distributions.

* Additional heterogeneity among sites in persistence and colonization or both.

* Additional detection heterogeneity at the site or survey level, with the possibility of a temporal trend in this heterogeneity over the years. E.g., an annual trend in detection heterogeneity at the site or the survey level is specified by the first and second value, which correspond to the heterogeneity in the first and the last year. Hence, trend.sd.site = c(0, 1) will result in a linear trend in the magnitude of site heterogeneity in detection from 0 in the first year to 1 in the last year.

* A single, spatially structured covariate for habitat suitability may affect all parameters via coefficient beta.XAC; for a biologically reasonable way, choose coefficients with the same sign for all 4 (mediated by underlying density). That spatial covariate is simulated as a Gaussian random field with negative exponential correlation function with 'range parameter' theta.XAC.

* Autologistic effects (beta.Xautolog) in persistence and colonization probability can be chosen, which fits a logistic regression of these parameters on the proportion of occupied neighboring cells (in a queen's or 2nd order neighborhood) during the previous time step.

* Additional detection heterogeneity can be introduced at the site- or the individual survey level, with the possibility of a temporal trend in this heterogeneity. For instance, an annual trend in detection heterogeneity at the site or the survey level is specified by the value in the first and the last year. Hence, trend.sd.site = c(0, 1) will result in a linear trend in the magnitude of site heterogeneity in detection from 0 in the first year to 1 in the last year.

Previous versions used \pkg{RandomFields}, but that is not currently available on CRAN. If not available, \pkg{fields} will be used, but it cannot deal with large values of \code{side} and \code{theta.XAC}.

}
 \item{beta.Xautolog}{
vector of coefficients of autologistic covariate in the following order: persistence (phi), colonization (gamma); the autocovariate is computed at every season as the proportion of occupied cells in a queen's neighborhood around each cell.
}
  \item{trend.sd.site}{

}
  \item{seed}{
