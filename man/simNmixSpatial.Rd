\title{
Simulate replicated counts under a spatial, static binomial N-mixture model
}
\description{
Simulates replicated counts under a spatial, static binomial N-mixture model for a semi-realistic landscape in a square of 50x50 km in the Bernese Oberland around Interlaken, Switzerland. Unit of the data simulation is a 1km2 quadrat, hence, there are 2500 units. It uses the data set \code{\link{BerneseOberland}}, which has covariates for elevation and forest cover.

For abundance, the function allows you to specify a quadratic effect of elevation. Then, a Gaussian spatial random field (s) with negative exponential correlation function is simulated using \code{\link{simExpCorrRF}}; you can set the variance and the range (scale) parameter theta. Basically, the larger the value of theta.RF, the bigger are the 'islands' simulated in the random field. The abundance in each quadrat (i) is built up via the following linear predictor:

\code{lambda[i] <- exp(beta0 + beta[1] * elev[i] + beta[2] * elev[i]^2 + s[i])} \cr
\code{N[i] ~ Poisson(lambda[i])}

Replicated counts are simulated as usual under a binomial observation model, and detection probability is allowed to vary by one site and one observational covariate: respectively quadrat forest cover (in the BerneseOberland data set), and wind-speed, which is invented data. Counts at each site (i) and for each occasion (j) are then produced according to the following model:

\code{  p[i,j] <- plogis(alpha0 + alpha[1] * forest[i] + alpha[2] * wind[i,j])} \cr
\code{C[i,j] ~ Binomial(N[i], p[i,j]) }

Finally, we assume that only a subset of the 2500 quadrats is surveyed. Hence, we allow you to choose the number of quadrats that are surveyed and these will then be randomly placed into the landscape. We then assume that counts will only be available for these surveyed quadrats, i.e., counts from all non-surveyed quadrats will be NA.

To recreate the data sets used in the book with R 3.6.0 or later, call \code{RNGversion="3.5.3"} before the call to \code{simNmixSpatial}. This should only be used for reproduction of old results.

}
\arguments{
  \item{nsurveys}{
number of surveys per quadrat.
}
  \item{mean.lambda}{
expected number of individuals at a quadrat with mean values of all covariates; \code{beta0} is \code{log(mean.lambda)}.
}
  \item{beta}{
vector of length 2, the linear and quadratic coefficients for the effect of elevation on abundance.
}
  \item{mean.p}{
Expected detection at the average value of all detection covariates (and ignoring all random effects): detection model
}
  \item{alpha}{
vector of length 2, the coefficients for the effect of forest and wind on detection.

the number of quadrats surveyed.
}
  \item{variance.RF}{
variance of the random field.

}
  \item{truncN}{
used to limit the range of values of N displayed in some plots.

if TRUE, output will be written to the console.
