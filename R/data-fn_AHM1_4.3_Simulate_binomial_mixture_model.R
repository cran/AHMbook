# Function to simulate data for binomial mixture model
#   (generally: spatially and temporally replicated counts)
# (introduced in AHM1 Section 4.3)
data.fn <- function(M = 267, J = 3, mean.lambda = 2, beta1 = -2, beta2 = 2, beta3 = 1, mean.detection = 0.3, alpha1 = 1, alpha2 = -3, alpha3 = 0, show.plot = TRUE){
#
# Function to simulate point counts replicated at M sites during J occasions.
# Population closure is assumed for each site.
# Expected abundance may be affected by elevation (elev),
# forest cover (forest) and their interaction.
# Expected detection probability may be affected by elevation,
# wind speed (wind) and their interaction.
# Function arguments:
#     M: Number of spatial replicates (sites)
#     J: Number of temporal replicates (occasions)
#     mean.lambda: Mean abundance at value 0 of abundance covariates
#     beta1: Main effect of elevation on abundance
#     beta2: Main effect of forest cover on abundance
#     beta3: Interaction effect on abundance of elevation and forest cover
#     mean.detection: Mean detection prob. at value 0 of detection covariates
#     alpha1: Main effect of elevation on detection probability
#     alpha2: Main effect of wind speed on detection probability
#     alpha3: Interaction effect on detection of elevation and wind speed
#     show.plot: if TRUE, plots of the data will be displayed;
#        set to FALSE if you are running simulations.
